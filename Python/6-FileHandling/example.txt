Agentic AI operates through a complex network of autonomous software components known as "agents" that draw from massive amounts of data and learn from user behavior to improve over time. 
Each agent is designed with specific goals and abilities, working in harmony to tackle complex tasks. 
This innovative approach to agentic AI relies on a blend of advanced technologies such as machine learning, NLP, and knowledge representation that helps agents learn, communicate, and reason effectively.

Agentic AI uses self-contained agents - AI models that autonomously complete tasks and manage workflows using machine learning, algorithms, and predictive analytics to make real-time decisions.
It follows a five-step process to solve complex problems:
 1. Perceive
 2. Reason
 3. Act
 4. Learn
 5. Collaborate
